Description: A light and eye-candy dock to launch your programs (metapackage)
 It uses Cairo / OpenGL to render graphics (many in correlation
 with Compiz) with full hardware acceleration. It's fully configurable and
 fully customisable and can be used as a taskbar too.
 You can easily add applets in the dock or as a desklet.
 It is recommended to install the PLUG-INS package (cairo-dock-plug-ins) to
 have acces to more views, dialogs and many plug-ins and applets.
 Some screenshots are available : http://pics.glx-dock.org
 .
 This metapackage provides the components necessary for running Cairo-Dock. It
 provides the Cairo-Dock core, a set of standard plugins and the files necessary
 to integrate Cairo-Dock with your desktop environment.
