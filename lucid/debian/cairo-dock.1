.SH NAME
cairo\-dock \- A dock to launch your programs easily.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B cairo\-dock
[options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cairo\-Dock
is a light and eye\-candy dock to launch your programs easily.
.PP
It uses 
.B Cairo
or
.B OpenGL
to render graphics (many in correlation with Compiz) with full hardware
acceleration. It's fully configurable and fully
customisable and can be used as a taskbar too.
.br
You can easily add applets in the dock or as a desklet.
.PP
It is recommended to install the PLUG\-INS package (
.B cairo\-dock\-plug\-ins
) to have acces to more views, dialogs and many plug\-ins and applets.
